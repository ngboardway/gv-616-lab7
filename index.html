  <h1 style="text-align:center;">CIS 616 Data Security and Privacy <br> Lab 06 - Ethical Hacking (2): Case 1</h1>

  <span><strong>Time Due: </strong>Monday, March 15, 2021</span>

  <span>Please answer all questions in the <strong>Answer Sheet</strong> at the bottom of this assignment; put your
    answers in a
    Word or PDF or a text file; submit your work by the due time through Blackboard to receive full credits
    for this assignment.</span>

  <h4 style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;">Legal Statement</h4>
  <p><i>We hack for learning, not learn for hacking. You are not allowed to use the techniques gained from this
      course for any malicious purpose. Any malicious action is <b>illegal</b> and will be <b>caught</b> and
      <b>prosecuted</b>.</i></p>

  <h4 style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;">Educational Objectives</h4>
  <p>
    Network scanning is an important part of pen testing to find network vulnerabilities, including
    misconfigurations, unused open ports, old applications, out of date security packages, and etc. When we
    have collected such data, we will be able to harden the network and computing systems. This case study is
    designed for the following educational objectives:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Students will gain hands-on experience with ethical hacking; then they will be able to better
      harden a network and a system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline;">Lab Environment</h4>
  <p>You can use any VM and technology you are familiar with. However, you need to work on our isolated
    network. Most of the work can be conducted with the Kali VM.</p>

  <b>Description</b>

  <p>Armed with the skills and the technologies you gained from previous labs; you are going to pen test our
    network:<br>
    192.168.218.0/23<br>
    Your work for this lab assignment will be two parts
  </p>

  <b>Task One (40%) </b>
  <p>You are asked to conduct pen test on the following network to identify any vulnerabilities:
    192.168.218.0/23 <br>
    Then, respond to the following question: <br>
  </p>

  <p><b>Question 01</b>: Briefly describe what you did and at least two kinds of vulnerabilities on the network.
    Discuss your strategy to harden the network.
  </p>

  <b>Task Two (20%)</b>
  <p>You are asked to download an open source tool to detect vulnerable processes and run it against one of the IP addresses where you found a
    vulnerability in Part 1.<br>This tool can be downloaded <a href="./process_detector.pyc">here</a> and run using python3.</p>

  <p><b>Question 02</b>: What impressed you about the results of this tool? How did they compare to the pen test you completed in Part 1?</p>

  <b>Task Three (40%) </b>

  <p>To receive this 40% for this lab, you are going to hack into a grader’s account and get the files that
    contain these credits.</p>

  <p>To facilitate your adventure, I have collected the following basic information for you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The grader’s account is on one of the following servers (IP):
      <ul>
        <li>192.168.218.146</li>
        <li>192.168.218.180</li>
        <li>192.168.218.212</li>
        <li>192.168.218.243</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The userID of the grader: cis616</li>
    <li>
      <span>(Hint) In order to crack the password, you may try a wordlist. A popular wordlist that is included
        in Kali Linux installation is from Rockyou project. You can find how to use it from the following link: <br>
        <a
          href="https://www.cyberpratibha.com/blog/how-do-i-use-rockyou-wordlist-txt-in-kali-linux/">https://www.cyberpratibha.com/blog/how-do-i-use-rockyou-wordlist-txt-in-kali-linux/</a>
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>(Reality) You don't have physical access to the server (it will be time-consuming to try each VM on this
      network).
      The server is physically locked in a secure room.</li>
    <li>(Hint) The utility scp may be useful</li>
  </ul>


  <p><b>Question 03:</b>: Briefly describe what you did to find the server with the grader’s account. Attach the
    grading files here. Use screenshots to demonstrate your work</p>

  <b><i>Congratulations! You have completed another lab for this course. Hope you enjoyed doing this lab.
